##Lab Exercise: Modifying a Selenium/WebDriver/Pytest Test Case
####Instructions from the instructor:

In this exercise, you will be exposed to Selenium/WebDriver with Python test case automation via a simple modification of a test case written by me. Your main challenge will probably be installation of all the components needed to run my test!

- Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), [pytest](http://pytest.org/latest/getting-started.html), and the Selenium/WebDriver [Python bindings](http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/) on your computer.
- Run the test--**A-links.py**. Do not proceed to the next step until you have the test case working!
- Modify the test to work for the 8 links assigned.
