##Lab Exercise: Github
####Instructions from the instructor:
- Sign up for a free [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.
- Check all of your Selenium files into your GitHub **repository** (often called *repo* for short), hopefully using a reasonable level of organization. For example, you might want to put IDE files in one dir, WebDriver files in another, and each test suite in its own sub-dir.
- Edit the **README.md** file to give some info about the contents of your repository, using **Markdown** syntax to format it.
