##Lab Exercise: Crowdtesting via RainforestQA
####Instructions from the instructor:

This lab exercise is a foray into **Crowdtesting** (also called **Crowd-Sourced Testing**) using [RainforestQA](https://www.rainforestqa.com/). Here's what you need to do for the exercise:

- Sign up for their Free Trial.
- Create a single test case (NSHSF, De Anza, or ResumeSmarts--your choice), complete with steps and questions. 
- Take a snapshot of your completed test case. 
- Do a **Preview** of your test case. RainforestQA will pop up a window with a **VM (Virtual Machine)** of the platform you select for the Preview.
- Start executing your test case in that VM.
- Take an image of the VM midway through your execution.
