#Lab Exercise: Accessibility Testing of a Web Page Using WAVE Assignment

Use a web accessibility checker to test any one of our three test sites you wish. You may use [WAVE](http://wave.webaim.org/) or a tool other than WAVE. Make sure that you're testing only a single page or very small subset of the site. If you find what you think is an accessibility bug in an "owned" page, file it via Bugzilla.

There is a lot to know about web accessibility issues, and it is recommended that you focus on missing **alt** values initially and read more about Accessibility and experiment with accessibility checker tools as much as possible!
