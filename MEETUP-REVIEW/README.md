##Technical Meetup One-Page Review
Write a one-page (double-spaced!) review of a technical [Meetup](http://meetup.com/) presentation related to testing, software quality assurance, etc. It would be best if you could actually attend a local Meetup and write up your review based on the presentation there. But if you prefer, you can write the review about a past Meetup, a recording of which has been posted; this is the case for many of them.
