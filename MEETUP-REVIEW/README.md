##Technical Meetup One-Page Review
Write a one-page (double-spaced!) review of a technical [Meetup](http://meetup.com/) presentation related to *testing*, *software quality assurance*, etc. It would be best if you could actually attend a local Meetup and write up your review based on the presentation there. But if you prefer, you can write the review about a past Meetup, a recording of which has been posted; this is the case for many of them.

Your reviews will be graded based on:

- A concise summary of the presentation's content, including its title
- Inclusion of the date of the presentation
- Inclusion of the name of the speaker and a sentence or two about him or her
- Your opinions of the presentation's content and delivery, along with the basis of those opinions
- An absence of spelling, punctuation, and grammatical errors.
