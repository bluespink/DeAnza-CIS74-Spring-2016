##Writing a Test Design Specification & Modified Test Procedure Specification

Write a formal **Test Design Specification** that follows the outline on pages 192-193 of your textbook:

1. **Test design specification identifier**. Use this naming scheme: yyyymmdd-LastnameFirstname-TDS.
2. **Features to be tested**. Provide the URL and overlay name if applicable. (For example, ResumeSmarts needs the latter, since it appears to be a Single Page App.) 
3. **Approach refinements**. You only need this if your tests would be best executed with the aid of some tool (such as BrowserStack's Screenshots for a TDS about rendering), or if they need to be executed on a specific browser or mobile device.
4. **Test identification**. This is the most important part of your TDS--a one-liner describing as succinctly as possible what each test case would test.

Once your TDS is complete, write a **Test Procedure Specification** (TPS) for just *one* of the test cases specified in your TDS. Use the slightly modified TPS outline given in your book on pages 193-194 to include the input and output specifications from the Test Case Specification from page 193. 

1. Test procedure specification identifier. Use this naming scheme: yyyymmdd-LastnameFirstname-TPS-nn, where nn is the number of the test case from your TDS which you are expanding in this TPS.
